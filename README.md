# Space Writing using Neural Network

Hello, and welcome to our project on space writing recognition, which includes the detection and recognition of writing activity in a long flow of motion data, which is one of the most exciting issues in the Artificial Intelligence sector. Space-writing is the concept of reading scripts in free space using the hand-palm or fingernails, or any writing implement such as a pen. In this research, we use a generic webcam and a neural network technique to distinguish solitary characters programmed in the Space. Space-Scripting is done with the use of a parabolic curve that works as a corrected marker beside a camera.
